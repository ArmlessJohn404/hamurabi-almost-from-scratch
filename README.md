# HAMURABI ALMOST FROM SCRATCH
This is an attempt of making the game [Hamurabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamurabi) using modern programming languages. The idea is to time the development and track the progress and the time it took to get in each stage in this document. If possible I want to finish this project in under 12 h.

Hamurabi is one of the first electronic games, arguably the first strategy game.
The game is set in Babylon, where the player is the ancient king [Hamurabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammurabi) and must control the resources to feed the people and purchase land for a period of ten game rounds.

The game is based in html5/canvas, CSS and ES6 javascript. Since every retro game I make, I change a few things, this time I'm drawing some icons to indicate the resources of the game.
